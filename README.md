## About

This is a MATLAB programm for solving numerically the highly oscillatory 1D Schr√∂dinger equation

Here, a(x) is a real valued coefficient function bounded away from zero and epsi is the rescaled Planck constant 0 < epsi << 1.

The routine automatically switches between a standard Runge-Kutta solver and a WKB-based stepping procedure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the programm the following requirements are needed:
* MATLAB

### Installation

Just clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JannisKoerner/adaptive-WKB-marching-method.git
   ```

## Usage

For a quick start you can just run the example file "Test_adaptive_WKB_marching_method_Airy.m" or "Test_adaptive_WKB_marching_method_PCF.m".
